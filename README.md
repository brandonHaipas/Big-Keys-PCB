# Big-Keys-PCB

In this repository I will be updating the files needed to print the PCB for the InCA:Big-Keys keyboard, which aim is to augmentate communication between human and non-human animals, specifically medium size non-human animals.
I'll be updating more details in [the project's page](https://bigkeys.incalab.cl/).
