# Big-Keys-PCB

In this repository I will be updating the files needed to print the PCB for the InCA:Big-Keys keyboard, which aim is to augmentate communication between human and non-human animals, specifically medium size non-human animals.
I'll be updating more details in [the project's page](https://bigkeys.incalab.cl/).
For the development of this project I followed the mechanical PCB guide made by ai03, [here's the guide](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide) if you want to create your own keypad or keyboard.
